   insert into "DM"."AN"."SNAPSHOTS" (SNAPSHOT_DATE)
    select DATE::timestamp from dm.rp.DIM_DATE
    where DATE between '2019-01-07' and dateadd(year, 10, '2019-01-07')
    and DAY_NUMBER=1
    order by date

---- If we did not have the table to get the dates from, we could use the Snowflake Generator function
